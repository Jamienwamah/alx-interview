The canUnlockAll() method takes in a list of lists boxes where each inner list represents a box and contains the keys to the other boxes. The method first initializes a boolean list unlocked of length n (the number of boxes) to keep track of which boxes are unlocked. It sets the first box boxes[0] to be unlocked and adds its keys to the keys list.

The method then uses a while loop to iterate through the keys list, popping off the first key and using it to unlock the corresponding box if it hasn't already been unlocked. If the box is unlocked, its keys are added to the keys list.

Finally, the method uses the all() method to check if all the boxes are unlocked, and returns True if they are and False otherwise.
